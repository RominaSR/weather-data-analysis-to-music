## 🎼 **PyComposition – Transforming Weather Data into Music** 🎶

🌍 **From Climate to Composition: A Data-driven Musical experiment**

This notebook explores the intersection between data science and music composition, using real weather data from OpenWeatherMap. Through a structured algorithmic process, it converts meteorological parameters such as temperature, wind, and humidity into musical elements like pitch, duration, and rhythm.

✨ **What does this Notebook do?**

✅ Extracts and analyzes weather data from the city of Nice, France (February 13–20, 2022, UTC+1)
✅ Processes and scales data to generate musical parameters
✅ Creates musical scores & melodies using the Music21 library
✅ Exports compositions in MusicXML & MIDI formats for further arrangement
✅ Visualizes pitch distribution, duration relationships, and tonal analysis
✅ Generates transpositions, melodic fragments, and harmonization from the data

This work serves as both an artistic and technical exploration, demonstrating how structured numerical patterns from meteorology can be transformed into expressive musical pieces. 🎵

🔗 **Try it out, use your weather data, modify the parameters, and create your own data-driven compositions!**
